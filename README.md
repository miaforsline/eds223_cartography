## Course description
Spatial analysis, broadly defined, is the study of the relationships between phenomena as a function of their positions and extents in two or more dimensions. When at least two of those dimensions correspond to the Earth’s surface, we are analyzing geographic information, the fundamental substrate of environmental science.

EDS 223 / ESM 267 takes a programming approach to geographic information: instead of using a geographic information system (GIS) application (e.g., ArcGIS; QGIS), we will be manipulating and analyzing geographic information by writing programs in R and Python. This approach gives you a deeper understanding of the underlying operations and data structures that support geographic information, and is also much more flexible in terms of the problems you can address—you’re not limited to the capabilities built into a particular GIS application.
